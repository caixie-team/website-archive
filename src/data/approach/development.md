We start development as early as possible, 
ensuring all aspects of the product – from design to usability – are working as expected. 
Before each sprint, we sit down with our clients to discuss priorities and develop a timeline focused on getting the product into the hands of the user early on.
After that, we simply repeat this same process of planning, 
building, and iterating until the product is the best it can be.

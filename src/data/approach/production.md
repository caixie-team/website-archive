The product discovery process is important because it helps teams build products that are vital to their customers, 
not simply nice to have. 
A necessary product is one that solves such a deep and genuine need for the customer that they feel unable to live without it. 
Examples range from Google search to smartphones to duct tape. Many of them evolve into verbs, as in “Google it.” The advantage here is obvious: Necessities enjoy higher demand and success.</p>\n<p>The difference between a necessity and a ‘nice to have’ product is effective product discovery. Without data to prove or disprove their assumptions, companies can waste tremendous amounts of money, time, and resources chasing unattainable or undesirable goals. To avoid product failure, companies must conduct product discovery that’s based upon data.
